% Historically a small number of students change the page layout,
% often accidentally by including a package like geometry or fullpage.
% Here we check if the basic page setup is correct. It does not
% check all aspects of the style guide, or any page limits.

% Changing the style in a way that fools these simple checks is still not ok!

\textbf{\large \em The required page layout has been changed.}

Please set up your document as in the example skeleton thesis document.
Do not change the page layout, or include packages like geometry,
savetrees, or fullpage, which change it for you.

We're not able to reliably undo arbitrary changes to the style. Please remove
the offending package(s), or layout-changing commands and try again. If you
can't figure out the problem, try adding your \LaTeX\ code a part at a time
to the example document.
